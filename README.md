# coreml-classification-app

Simple boilerplate code of iOS application for classification with Core ML model. It uses iPhone/iPad camera to capture live stream and classify. The model is trained for detecting roads with rocks and without.

The model is trained with Turi Create. Check out my repository for how to train Core ML models with Turi Create for multi classification https://github.com/mngaonkar/image-classification-coreml.
